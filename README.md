The objective of this project is to organize the data from the monthly ttc batch obtained from the website, currently in raw CSV format, into an Excel file. The Excel file will be structured to include specific fields and distribute data across multiple sheets. This approach aims to facilitate efficient management and streamline processes within the Ashram.
